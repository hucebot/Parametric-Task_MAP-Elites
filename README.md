## Abstract
Optimizing a set of functions simultaneously by leveraging their similarity is called multi-task optimization. Current black-box multi-task algorithms only solve a finite set of tasks, even when the tasks originate from a continuous space. In this paper, we introduce Parametric-Task MAP-Elites (PT-ME), a new black-box algorithm for continuous multi-task optimization problems. This algorithm (1) solves a new task at each iteration, effectively covering the continuous space, and (2) exploits a new variation operator based on local linear regression. The resulting dataset of solutions makes it possible to create a function that maps any task parameter to its optimal solution. We show that PT-ME outperforms all baselines, including the deep reinforcement learning algorithm PPO on two parametric-task toy problems and a robotic problem in simulation.

(a) Quality-Diversity is the problem of finding high-performing solutions with diverse behaviors. (b) Multi-task optimization is the problem of finding the optimum solutions for a finite set of tasks, each often characterized by a task parameter (or descriptor). (c) In this paper, we propose to extend the multi-task optimization problem to a continuous parametrization, which we call Parametric-Task Optimization. The goal is to be able to return the optimal solution for any task parameter.

## Content of the repository

### Folder: To_Run_PT-ME

This folder contains one-file notebooks to run the Parametric-Task MAP-Elites (PT-ME) algorithm on the two toy problems (10-DoF Arm and Archery).
For simplicity, these notebooks execute the default variant of PT-ME (called **PT-ME (ours)** in the paper).

#### Expected results

The "Execute" node should take about 1 minute to execute 100,000 iterations of PT-ME.

##### On the 10-DoF Arm problem
the node "Solutions on the task space" should show a similar image:

The node "QD-Score Figure" should show a similar image:
